Mountain Range

A group of brave settlers has made their way to this rough mountain terrain.

You might encounter earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or meteorite impacts.

Your goal is to mine all ore found in the hills.

As soon as you have gained enough wealth, you can buy additional flags and attach them to new homebase buildings.
