Water Caves

Beneath an ancient dormant volcano south east of the great desert a lake has formed from ground water inside a system of caves with suprisingly flourishing plant and animal life.

But beware, the caves are very dark. Use torches to lighten your settlement and you may well succeed in conquering this underground world. Torches can be built on the anvil and attached to tunnels walls.

Hint: there's a huge vein of gold and crystal at the bottom of the lake.
