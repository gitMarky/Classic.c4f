Foggy Cliffs

At the Northern end of the known ocean lies a group of islands called Foggy Cliffs. The group consists of a number of very steep islands in temperate if rather cold climate.

Since the area sees lots of persisting winds but hardly any thunderstorms, it is quite suitable for wind power generation. There are none of the really valuable resources such as gold or oil to be found, however, you will be able to make a living of what is there.

The goal is to achive 2000 settlement points.
